# NuggetBotSqueak Website

This website is for the NuggetBotSqueak Discord bot ([here's the git repository](https://github.com/potatoland4492/NuggetBotSqueak)).

## New and Potential Developers

If you are interested in developing this bot or website, join the [official development Discord server](https://discord.gg/invite/6DSKgJXtFH). Note that this Discord bot is written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and uses [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org). (And in case you're wondering, yes, I have had people who only know Python try to join.) The website is written in HTML and uses a handful of CSS too. Minimal JavaScript knowledge is required for handling event listeners for buttons.

## Current Developers

A list of resources can be found on the website, but here they are again:

- [The bot's Repl on Replit](https://replit.com/@akhilpil0308/NuggetBotSqueak#index.js)
- [Discord.js v12 documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/v12/general/welcome) (yes, we're using v12 for reasons [aka [Replit](https://replit.com) can't run a higher version])
- [The bot's git repository on Github](https://github.com/potatoland4492/NuggetBotSqueak)
